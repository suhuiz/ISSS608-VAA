# **Visualising Distribution**

## **Getting Started**

### **Installing and loading the packages**

For the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:

-   ggridges, a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots,

-   ggdist, a ggplot2 extension spacially desgin for visualising distribution and uncertainty,

-   tidyverse, a family of R packages to meet the modern data science and visual communication needs,

-   ggthemes, a ggplot extension that provides the user additional themes, scales, and geoms for the ggplots package, and

-   colorspace, an R package provides a broad toolbox for selecting individual colors or color palettes, manipulating these colors, and employing them in various kinds of visualisations.

The code chunk below will be used load these R packages into RStudio environment.

```{R}
pacman::p_load(ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes,
               colorspace, tidyverse)
```

### **Data import**

For the purpose of this exercise, *Exam_data.csv* will be used.

In the code chunk below, [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package is used to import *Exam_data.csv*into R and saved it into a tibble data.frame.

```{R}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

## **Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot**

[*Ridgeline plot*](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/ridgeline.html) (sometimes called *Joyplot*) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.

Figure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.

![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap09_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

**Note**

-   Ridgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.

-   It works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.

### **Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method**

There are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using [ggridges](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/index.html) package.

ggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: [`geom_ridgeline()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/geom_ridgeline.html) and [`geom_density_ridges()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/geom_density_ridges.html). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.

The ridgeline plot below is plotted by using `geom_density_ridges()`.

```{R}
ggplot(exam, 
       aes(x = ENGLISH, 
           y = CLASS)) +
  geom_density_ridges(
    scale = 3,
    rel_min_height = 0.01,
    bandwidth = 3.4,
    fill = lighten("#7097BB", .3),
    color = "white"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = "English grades",
    expand = c(0, 0)
    ) +
  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +
  theme_ridges()
```

### **Varying fill colors along the x axis**

Sometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either [`geom_ridgeline_gradient()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/geom_ridgeline_gradient.html) or [`geom_density_ridges_gradient()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/geom_ridgeline_gradient.html). Both geoms work just like `geom_ridgeline()` and `geom_density_ridges()`, except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.

```{R}
ggplot(exam, 
       aes(x = ENGLISH, 
           y = CLASS,
           fill = after_stat(x))) +
  geom_density_ridges_gradient(
    scale = 3,
    rel_min_height = 0.01) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Temp. [F]",
                       option = "C") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = "English grades",
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) +
  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +
  theme_ridges()
```

### **Mapping the probabilities directly onto colour**

Beside providing additional geom objects to support the need to plot ridgeline plot, ggridges package also provides a stat function called [`stat_density_ridges()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/stat_density_ridges.html) that replaces [`stat_density()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_density.html) of ggplot2.

Figure below is plotted by mapping the probabilities calculated by using `stat(ecdf)` which represent the empirical cumulative density function for the distribution of English score.

```{R}
ggplot(exam,
       aes(x = ENGLISH, 
           y = CLASS, 
           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5-stat(ecdf)))) +
  stat_density_ridges(geom = "density_ridges_gradient", 
                      calc_ecdf = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Tail probability",
                       direction = -1) +
  theme_ridges()
```

**Important**

It is important include the argument `calc_ecdf = TRUE` in `stat_density_ridges()`.

### **Ridgeline plots with quantile lines**

By using [`geom_density_ridges_gradient()`](https://wilkelab.org/ggridges/reference/geom_ridgeline_gradient.html), we can colour the ridgeline plot by quantile, via the calculated `stat(quantile)` aesthetic as shown in the figure below.

```{R}
ggplot(exam,
       aes(x = ENGLISH, 
           y = CLASS, 
           fill = factor(stat(quantile))
           )) +
  stat_density_ridges(
    geom = "density_ridges_gradient",
    calc_ecdf = TRUE, 
    quantiles = 4,
    quantile_lines = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = "Quartiles") +
  theme_ridges()
```

Instead of using number to define the quantiles, we can also specify quantiles by cut points such as 2.5% and 97.5% tails to colour the ridgeline plot as shown in the figure below.

```{R}
ggplot(exam,
       aes(x = ENGLISH, 
           y = CLASS, 
           fill = factor(stat(quantile))
           )) +
  stat_density_ridges(
    geom = "density_ridges_gradient",
    calc_ecdf = TRUE, 
    quantiles = c(0.025, 0.975)
    ) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    name = "Probability",
    values = c("#FF0000A0", "#A0A0A0A0", "#0000FFA0"),
    labels = c("(0, 0.025]", "(0.025, 0.975]", "(0.975, 1]")
  ) +
  theme_ridges()
```

## **Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot**

Raincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!

In this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by **ggdist** and ggplot2 packages.

### **Plotting a Half Eye graph**

First, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using [`stat_halfeye()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_halfeye.html) of **ggdist** package.

This produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.

```{R}
ggplot(exam, 
       aes(x = RACE, 
           y = ENGLISH)) +
  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,
               justification = -0.2,
               .width = 0,
               point_colour = NA)
```

**Things to learn from the code chunk above**

We remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.

### **Adding the boxplot with `geom_boxplot()`**

Next, we will add the second geometry layer using [`geom_boxplot()`](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap09) of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.

```{R}
ggplot(exam, 
       aes(x = RACE, 
           y = ENGLISH)) +
  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,
               justification = -0.2,
               .width = 0,
               point_colour = NA) +
  geom_boxplot(width = .20,
               outlier.shape = NA)
```

### **Adding the Dot Plots with `stat_dots()`**

Next, we will add the third geometry layer using [`stat_dots()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_dots.html) of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.

```{R}
ggplot(exam, 
       aes(x = RACE, 
           y = ENGLISH)) +
  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,
               justification = -0.2,
               .width = 0,
               point_colour = NA) +
  geom_boxplot(width = .20,
               outlier.shape = NA) +
  stat_dots(side = "left", 
            justification = 1.2, 
            binwidth = .5,
            dotsize = 2)
```

### **Finishing touch**

Lastly, [`coord_flip()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_flip.html) of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, `theme_economist()` of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.

```{R}
ggplot(exam, 
       aes(x = RACE, 
           y = ENGLISH)) +
  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,
               justification = -0.2,
               .width = 0,
               point_colour = NA) +
  geom_boxplot(width = .20,
               outlier.shape = NA) +
  stat_dots(side = "left", 
            justification = 1.2, 
            binwidth = .5,
            dotsize = 1.5) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_economist()
```

# **Visual Statistical Analysis**

## **Visual Statistical Analysis with ggstatsplot**

[**ggstatsplot**](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/index.html) ![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap10/img/image1.jpg){width="47" height="55"} is an extension of [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the information-rich plots themselves.

```         
-   To provide alternative statistical inference methods by default.
-   To follow best practices for statistical reporting. For all statistical tests reported in the plots, the default template abides by the [APA](https://my.ilstu.edu/~jhkahn/apastats.html) gold standard for statistical reporting. For example, here are results from a robust t-test:
```

![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap10/img/image2.jpg)

## **Getting Started**

### **Installing and launching R packages**

In this exercise, **ggstatsplot** and **tidyverse** will be used.

```{R}
pacman::p_load(ggstatsplot, tidyverse)
```

### **Importing data**

```{R}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

### **One-sample test: *gghistostats()* method**

In the code chunk below, [*gghistostats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/gghistostats.html) is used to to build an visual of one-sample test on English scores.

```{R}
set.seed(1234)

gghistostats(
  data = exam,
  x = ENGLISH,
  type = "bayes",
  test.value = 60,
  xlab = "English scores"
)
```

Default information: - statistical details - Bayes Factor - sample sizes - distribution summary

### **Unpacking the Bayes Factor**

-   A Bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.

-   That’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.

-   When we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as

![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap10/img/image5.jpg)

-   The [**Schwarz criterion**](https://www.statisticshowto.com/bayesian-information-criterion/) is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.

### **How to interpret Bayes Factor**

A **Bayes Factor** can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one—first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by [Lee and Wagenmakers](https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy.smu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1080/00031305.1999.10474443?needAccess=true) in 2013:

           y = GENDER)
```

# **Visualising Uncertainty**

## **Getting Started**

### **Installing and loading the packages**

For the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:

-   tidyverse, a family of R packages for data science process,

-   plotly for creating interactive plot,

-   gganimate for creating animation plot,

-   DT for displaying interactive html table,

-   crosstalk for for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering), and

-   ggdist for visualising distribution and uncertainty.

```{R}
pacman::p_load(plotly, crosstalk, DT, 
               ggdist, ggridges, colorspace,
               gganimate, tidyverse)
```

### **Data import**

For the purpose of this exercise, *Exam_data.csv* will be used.

```{R}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

## **Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggplot2 methods**

A point estimate is a single number, such as a mean. Uncertainty, on the other hand, is expressed as standard error, confidence interval, or credible interval.

**Important**

-   Don’t confuse the uncertainty of a point estimate with the variation in the sample

In this section, you will learn how to plot error bars of maths scores by race by using data provided in *exam* tibble data frame.

Firstly, code chunk below will be used to derive the necessary summary statistics.

```{R}
my_sum <- exam %>%
  group_by(RACE) %>%
  summarise(
    n=n(),
    mean=mean(MATHS),
    sd=sd(MATHS)
    ) %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n-1))
```

**Things to learn from the code chunk above**

-   `group_by()` of **dplyr** package is used to group the observation by RACE,

-   `summarise()` is used to compute the count of observations, mean, standard deviation

-   `mutate()` is used to derive standard error of Maths by RACE, and

-   the output is save as a tibble data table called *my_sum*.

Next, the code chunk below will be used to display *my_sum* tibble data frame in an html table format.

```{R}
knitr::kable(head(my_sum), format = 'html')
```

### **Plotting standard error bars of point estimates**

Now we are ready to plot the standard error bars of mean maths score by race as shown below.

```{R}
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=RACE, 
        ymin=mean-se, 
        ymax=mean+se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    linewidth=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  ggtitle("Standard error of mean maths score by rac")
```

**Things to learn from the code chunk above**

-   The error bars are computed by using the formula mean+/-se.

-   For `geom_point()`, it is important to indicate *stat=“identity”*.

### **Plotting confidence interval of point estimates**

Instead of plotting the standard error bar of point estimates, we can also plot the confidence intervals of mean maths score by race.

```{R}
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=reorder(RACE, -mean), 
        ymin=mean-1.96*se, 
        ymax=mean+1.96*se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    linewidth=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  labs(x = "Maths score",
       title = "95% confidence interval of mean maths score by race")
```

### **Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates with interactive error bars**

In this section, you will learn how to plot interactive error bars for the 99% confidence interval of mean maths score by race as shown in the figure below.

```{R}
shared_df = SharedData$new(my_sum)

bscols(widths = c(4,8),
       ggplotly((ggplot(shared_df) +
                   geom_errorbar(aes(
                     x=reorder(RACE, -mean),
                     ymin=mean-2.58*se, 
                     ymax=mean+2.58*se), 
                     width=0.2, 
                     colour="black", 
                     alpha=0.9, 
                     linewidth=0.5) +
                   geom_point(aes(
                     x=RACE, 
                     y=mean, 
                     text = paste("Race:", `RACE`, 
                                  "<br>N:", `n`,
                                  "<br>Avg. Scores:", round(mean, digits = 2),
                                  "<br>95% CI:[", 
                                  round((mean-2.58*se), digits = 2), ",",
                                  round((mean+2.58*se), digits = 2),"]")),
                     stat="identity", 
                     color="red", 
                     size = 1.5, 
                     alpha=1) + 
                   xlab("Race") + 
                   ylab("Average Scores") + 
                   theme_minimal() + 
                   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(
                     angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +

## **Visualising Uncertainty: ggdist package**

-   [**ggdist**](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/index.html) is an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats designed especially for visualising distributions and uncertainty.

-   It is designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization:

    -   for frequentist models, one visualises confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette(“freq-uncertainty-vis”));

    -   for Bayesian models, one visualises probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist).

### **Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdistmethods**

In the code chunk below, [`stat_pointinterval()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_pointinterval.html) of **ggdist** is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.

```{R}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval() +
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

Note This function comes with many arguments, students are advised to read the syntax reference for more detail. For example, in the code chunk below the following arguments are used:

-   .width = 0.95

-   .point = median

-   .interval = qi

```{R}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval(.width = 0.95,
  .point = median,
  .interval = qi) +
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of median math score",
    subtitle = "Median Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

### **Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdistmethods**

```{R}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval(
    .width = c(0.95, 0.99),
    show.legend = FALSE) +   
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

### **Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggdistmethods**

In the code chunk below, [`stat_gradientinterval()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_gradientinterval.html) of **ggdist** is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.

```{R}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_gradientinterval(   
    fill = "skyblue",      
    show.legend = TRUE     
  ) +                        
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Gradient + interval plot")
```

## **Visualising Uncertainty with Hypothetical Outcome Plots (HOPs)**

### **Installing ungeviz package**

```{R}
devtools::install_github("wilkelab/ungeviz")
```

Note: You only need to perform this step once.

### **11.5.2 Launch the application in R**

```{R}
library(ungeviz)
```

### **Visualising Uncertainty with Hypothetical Outcome Plots (HOPs)**

Next, the code chunk below will be used to build the HOPs.

```{R}
ggplot(data = exam, 
       (aes(x = factor(RACE), 
            y = MATHS))) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(
    height = 0.3, 
    width = 0.05), 
    size = 0.4, 
    color = "#0072B2", 
    alpha = 1/2) +
  geom_hpline(data = sampler(25, 
                             group = RACE), 
              height = 0.6, 
              color = "#D55E00") +
  theme_bw() + 
  transition_states(.draw, 1, 3)
```

# **Funnel Plots for Fair Comparisons**

## **Overview**

Funnel plot is a specially designed data visualisation for conducting unbiased comparison between outlets, stores or business entities. By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:

-   plotting funnel plots by using **funnelPlotR** package,

-   plotting static funnel plot by using ggplot2 package, and

-   plotting interactive funnel plot by using both **plotly R** and **ggplot2** packages.

## **Installing and Launching R Packages**

In this exercise, four R packages will be used. They are:

-   **readr** for importing csv into R.

-   **FunnelPlotR** for creating funnel plot.

-   **ggplot2** for creating funnel plot manually.

-   **knitr** for building static html table.

-   **plotly** for creating interactive funnel plot.

```{R}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, FunnelPlotR, plotly, knitr)
```

## **Importing Data**

In this section, COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta will be used. The data was downloaded from [Open Data Covid-19 Provinsi DKI Jakarta portal](https://riwayat-file-covid-19-dki-jakarta-jakartagis.hub.arcgis.com/). For this hands-on exercise, we are going to compare the cumulative COVID-19 cases and death by sub-district (i.e. kelurahan) as at 31st July 2021, DKI Jakarta.

The code chunk below imports the data into R and save it into a tibble data frame object called *covid19*.

```{R}
covid19 <- read_csv("data/COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta.csv") %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
```

## **FunnelPlotR methods**

[**FunnelPlotR**](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/FunnelPlotR/) package uses ggplot to generate funnel plots. It requires a `numerator` (events of interest), `denominator` (population to be considered) and `group`. The key arguments selected for customisation are:

-   `limit`: plot limits (95 or 99).

-   `label_outliers`: to label outliers (true or false).

-   `Poisson_limits`: to add Poisson limits to the plot.

-   `OD_adjust`: to add overdispersed limits to the plot.

-   `xrange` and `yrange`: to specify the range to display for axes, acts like a zoom function.

-   Other aesthetic components such as graph title, axis labels etc.

### **8.4.1 FunnelPlotR methods: The basic plot**

The code chunk below plots a funnel plot.

```{R}
funnel_plot(
  .data = covid19,
  numerator = Positive,
  denominator = Death,
  group = `Sub-district`
)
```

Things to learn from the code chunk above.

-   `group` in this function is different from the scatterplot. Here, it defines the level of the points to be plotted i.e. Sub-district, District or City. If Cityc is chosen, there are only six data points.

-   By default, `data_type`argument is “SR”.

-   `limit`: Plot limits, accepted values are: 95 or 99, corresponding to 95% or 99.8% quantiles of the distribution.

### **FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 1**

The code chunk below plots a funnel plot.

```{R}
funnel_plot(
  .data = covid19,
  numerator = Death,
  denominator = Positive,
  group = `Sub-district`,
  data_type = "PR",     #<<
  xrange = c(0, 6500),  #<<
  yrange = c(0, 0.05)   #<<
)
```

Things to learn from the code chunk above. + `data_type` argument is used to change from default “SR” to “PR” (i.e. proportions). + `xrange` and `yrange` are used to set the range of x-axis and y-axis

### **FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 2**

The code chunk below plots a funnel plot.

```{R}
funnel_plot(
  .data = covid19,
  numerator = Death,
  denominator = Positive,
  group = `Sub-district`,
  data_type = "PR",   
  xrange = c(0, 6500),  
  yrange = c(0, 0.05),
  label = NA,
  title = "Cumulative COVID-19 Fatality Rate by Cumulative Total Number of COVID-19 Positive Cases", #<<           
  x_label = "Cumulative COVID-19 Positive Cases", #<<
  y_label = "Cumulative Fatality Rate"  #<<
)
```

Things to learn from the code chunk above.

-   `label = NA` argument is to removed the default label outliers feature.

-   `title` argument is used to add plot title.

-   `x_label` and `y_label` arguments are used to add/edit x-axis and y-axis titles.

## **Funnel Plot for Fair Visual Comparison: ggplot2 methods**

In this section, you will gain hands-on experience on building funnel plots step-by-step by using ggplot2. It aims to enhance you working experience of ggplot2 to customise speciallised data visualisation like funnel plot.

### **Computing the basic derived fields**

To plot the funnel plot from scratch, we need to derive cumulative death rate and standard error of cumulative death rate.

```{R}
df <- covid19 %>%
  mutate(rate = Death / Positive) %>%
  mutate(rate.se = sqrt((rate*(1-rate)) / (Positive))) %>%
  filter(rate > 0)
```

Next, the *fit.mean* is computed by using the code chunk below.

```{R}
fit.mean <- weighted.mean(df$rate, 1/df$rate.se^2)
```

### **Calculate lower and upper limits for 95% and 99.9% CI**

The code chunk below is used to compute the lower and upper limits for 95% confidence interval.

```{R}
number.seq <- seq(1, max(df$Positive), 1)
number.ll95 <- fit.mean - 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
number.ul95 <- fit.mean + 1.96 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
number.ll999 <- fit.mean - 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
number.ul999 <- fit.mean + 3.29 * sqrt((fit.mean*(1-fit.mean)) / (number.seq)) 
dfCI <- data.frame(number.ll95, number.ul95, number.ll999, 
                   number.ul999, number.seq, fit.mean)
```

### **Plotting a static funnel plot**

In the code chunk below, ggplot2 functions are used to plot a static funnel plot.

```{R}
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = Positive, y = rate)) +
  geom_point(aes(label=`Sub-district`), 
             alpha=0.4) +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ll95), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40", 
            linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ul95), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40", 
            linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ll999), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40") +
  geom_line(data = dfCI, 
            aes(x = number.seq, 
                y = number.ul999), 
            size = 0.4, 
            colour = "grey40") +
  geom_hline(data = dfCI, 
             aes(yintercept = fit.mean), 
             size = 0.4, 
             colour = "grey40") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,0.05)) +
  annotate("text", x = 1, y = -0.13, label = "95%", size = 3, colour = "grey40") + 
  annotate("text", x = 4.5, y = -0.18, label = "99%", size = 3, colour = "grey40") + 
  ggtitle("Cumulative Fatality Rate by Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases") +
  xlab("Cumulative Number of COVID-19 Cases") + 
  ylab("Cumulative Fatality Rate") +
  theme_light() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12),
        legend.position = c(0.91,0.85), 
        legend.title = element_text(size=7),
        legend.text = element_text(size=7),
        legend.background = element_rect(colour = "grey60", linetype = "dotted"),
        legend.key.height = unit(0.3, "cm"))
p
```

### **Interactive Funnel Plot: plotly + ggplot2**

The funnel plot created using ggplot2 functions can be made interactive with `ggplotly()`of **plotly** r package.

```{R}
fp_ggplotly <- ggplotly(p,
  tooltip = c("label", 
              "x", 
              "y"))
fp_ggplotly
```
