Then, the question is why ggplot2 is recommended?\nAs pointed out by Hadley Wickham\nImportant\nThe transferable skills from ggplot2 are not the idiosyncrasies of plotting syntax, but a powerful way of thinking about visualisation, as a way of mapping between variables and the visual properties of geometric objects that you can perceive.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we getting started using ggplot2, it is important for us to understand the principles of Grammer of Graphics.\nGrammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us call the ggplot() function using the code chunk below.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\nA blank canvas appears.\nggplot() initializes a ggplot object.\nThe data argument defines the dataset to be used for plotting.\nIf the dataset is not already a data.frame, it will be converted to one by fortify().\n\n\n\n\nThe aesthetic mappings take attributes of the data and and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colour, size, shape, or transparency. Each visual characteristic can thus encode an aspect of the data and be used to convey information.\nAll aesthetics of a plot are specified in the aes() function call (in later part of this lesson, you will see that each geom layer can have its own aes specification)\nCode chunk below adds the aesthetic element into the plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\nggplot includes the x-axis and the axis’s label.\n\n\n\n\nGeometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include:\n\ngeom_point for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)\ngeom_smooth for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)\ngeom_bar for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts)\ngeom_histogram for drawing binned values (e.g. a histogram)\ngeom_polygon for drawing arbitrary shapes\ngeom_map for drawing polygons in the shape of a map! (You can access the data to use for these maps by using the map_data() function).\n\n\n\nA plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the + operator.\nFor complete list, please refer to here.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots a bar chart by using geom_bar().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a dot plot, the width of a dot corresponds to the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning algorithm), and dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation.\nIn the code chunk below, geom_dotplot() of ggplot2 is used to plot a dot plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)\n\nBin width defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data. Pick better value with\n`binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe warned\nThe y scale is not very useful, in fact it is very misleading.\nNote\nThe code chunk below performs the following two steps:\n\nscale_y_continuous() is used to turn off the y-axis, and\nbinwidth argument is used to change the binwidth to 2.5.\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, geom_histogram() is used to create a simple histogram by using values in MATHS field of exam_data.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram()      \n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\nNote that the default bin is 30.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\nbins argument is used to change the number of bins to 20,\nfill argument is used to shade the histogram with light blue color, and\ncolor argument is used to change the outline colour of the bars in black\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20,            \n                 color=\"black\",      \n                 fill=\"light blue\")  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below changes the interior colour of the histogram (i.e. fill) by using sub-group of aesthetic().\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"grey30\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\nThis approach can be used to colour, fill and alpha of the geometric.\n\n\n\ngeom-density() computes and plots kernel density estimate, which is a smoothed version of the histogram.\nIt is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.\nThe code below plots the distribution of Maths scores in a kernel density estimate plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density()      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots two kernel density lines by using colour or fill arguments of aes()\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           colour = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually.\nThe code chunk below plots boxplots by using geom_boxplot().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS,       \n           x= GENDER)) +    \n  geom_boxplot()           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotches are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\nThe code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot()and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistics functions statistically transform data, usually as some form of summary. For example:\n\nfrequency of values of a variable (bar graph)\n\na mean\na confidence limit\n\nThere are two ways to use these functions:\n\nadd a stat_() function and override the default geom, or\nadd a geom_() function and override the default stat.\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplots below are incomplete because the positions of the means were not shown.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adds mean values by using stat_summary() function and overriding the default geom.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun = \"mean\",         \n               colour =\"red\",        \n               size=4)               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adding mean values by using geom_() function and overriding the default stat.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_point(stat=\"summary\",        \n             fun=\"mean\",           \n             colour=\"red\",          \n             size=4)        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot below shows the relationship of Maths and English grades of pupils. The interpretability of this graph can be improved by adding a best fit curve.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, geom_smooth() is used to plot a best fit curve on the scatterplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(size=0.5)\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\nThe default method used is loess.\n\nThe default smoothing method can be overridden as shown below.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              linewidth=0.5)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacetting generates small multiples (sometimes also called trellis plot), each displaying a different subset of the data. They are an alternative to aesthetics for displaying additional discrete variables. ggplot2 supports two types of factes, namely: facet_grid() and facet_wrap.\n\n\nfacet_wrap wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d. This is generally a better use of screen space than facet_grid because most displays are roughly rectangular.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet-wrap().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacet_grid() forms a matrix of panels defined by row and column facetting variables. It is most useful when you have two discrete variables, and all combinations of the variables exist in the data.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet_grid().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_grid(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coordinates functions map the position of objects onto the plane of the plot. There are a number of different possible coordinate systems to use, they are:\n\ncoord_cartesian(): the default cartesian coordinate systems, where you specify x and y values (e.g. allows you to zoom in or out).\ncoord_flip(): a cartesian system with the x and y flipped.\ncoord_fixed(): a cartesian system with a “fixed” aspect ratio (e.g. 1.78 for a “widescreen” plot).\ncoord_quickmap(): a coordinate system that approximates a good aspect ratio for maps.\n\n\n\nBy the default, the bar chart of ggplot2 is in vertical form.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below flips the horizontal bar chart into vertical bar chart by using coord_flip().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot on the right is slightly misleading because the y-aixs and x-axis range are not equal.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below fixed both the y-axis and x-axis range from 0-100.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes control elements of the graph not related to the data. For example:\n\nbackground colour\nsize of fonts\ngridlines\ncolour of labels\n\nBuilt-in themes include: - theme_gray() (default) - theme_bw() - theme_classic()\nA list of theme can be found at this link. Each theme element can be conceived of as either a line (e.g. x-axis), a rectangle (e.g. graph background), or text (e.g. axis title).\n\n\nThe code chunk below plot a horizontal bar chart using theme_gray().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_gray()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_classic().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_minimal().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadley Wickham (2023) ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.

There are several ggplot2 extensions provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. In this section, you will learn how to create composite plot by combining multiple graphs. First, let us create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\")\n\nNext\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of English scores\")\n\nLastly, we will draw a scatterplot for English score versus Maths score by as shown below\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x= MATHS, \n                 y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ggplot2 extension’s functions support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as grid.arrange() of gridExtra package and plot_grid() of cowplot package. In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\n\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatchwork R package goes nerd viral\nggrepel\nggthemes\nhrbrthemes\nggplot tips: Arranging plots\nggplot2 Theme Elements Demonstration\nggplot2 Theme Elements Reference Sheet"

    "text": "First, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:\n\nggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\nDT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\npatchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.\n\npacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, \n               patchwork, DT, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, Exam_data.csv provided will be used. Using read_csv() of readr package, import Exam_data.csv into R.\nThe code chunk below read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called exam_data.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\nRows: 322 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (4): ID, CLASS, GENDER, RACE\ndbl (3): ENGLISH, MATHS, SCIENCE\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n\nggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\n\n\n\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css &lt;- \"background-color:white; #&lt;&lt;\nfont-style:bold; color:black;\" #&lt;&lt;\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(    #&lt;&lt;\n    opts_tooltip(    #&lt;&lt;\n      css = tooltip_css)) #&lt;&lt;\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the background colour of the tooltip is black and the font colour is white and bold.\n\nRefer to Customizing girafe objects to learn more about how to customise ggiraph objects.\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.\n\ntooltip &lt;- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {\n  mean &lt;- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  sem &lt;- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  paste(\"Mean maths scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem)\n}\n\ngg_point &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n                   aes(x = RACE),\n) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS, \n                   tooltip = after_stat(  \n                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  \n    fun.data = \"mean_se\", \n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,  \n    fill = \"light blue\"\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS),\n    fun.data = mean_se,\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, size = 0.2\n  )\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\ngirafe(ggobj = gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below shows the second interactive feature of ggiraph, namely data_id.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(           \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),             \n    stackgroups = TRUE,               \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618                      \n)\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\nNote that the default value of the hover css is hover_css = “fill:orange;”.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, css codes are used to change the highlighting effect.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\nNote: Different from previous example, in this example the ccs customisation request are encoded directly.\n\n\n\nThere are time that we want to combine tooltip and hover effect on the interactive statistical graph as shown in the code chunk below.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = CLASS, \n        data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.

Different from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.\n\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:\n\nby using plot_ly(), and\nby using ggplotly()\n\n\n\nThe tabset below shows an example a basic interactive plot created by using plot_ly().\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH)\n\nNo trace type specified:\n  Based on info supplied, a 'scatter' trace seems appropriate.\n  Read more about this trace type -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter\n\n\nNo scatter mode specifed:\n  Setting the mode to markers\n  Read more about this attribute -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter-mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, color argument is mapped to a qualitative visual variable (i.e. RACE).\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~ENGLISH, \n        y = ~MATHS, \n        color = ~RACE)\n\nNo trace type specified:\n  Based on info supplied, a 'scatter' trace seems appropriate.\n  Read more about this trace type -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter\n\n\nNo scatter mode specifed:\n  Setting the mode to markers\n  Read more about this attribute -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter-mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the only extra line you need to include in the code chunk is ggplotly().\n\n\n\nThe creation of a coordinated linked plot by using plotly involves three steps:\n\nhighlight_key() of plotly package is used as shared data.\ntwo scatterplots will be created by using ggplot2 functions.\nlastly, subplot() of plotly package is used to place them next to each other side-by-side.\n\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight_key() simply creates an object of class crosstalk::SharedData.\nVisit this link to learn more about crosstalk.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrosstalk is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).\n\n\n\nA wrapper of the JavaScript Library DataTables\nData objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library ‘DataTables’ (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).\n\n\nDT::datatable(exam_data, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below is used to implement the coordinated brushing shown above.\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data) \np &lt;- ggplot(d, \n            aes(ENGLISH, \n                MATHS)) + \n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg &lt;- highlight(ggplotly(p),        \n                \"plotly_selected\")  \n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,               \n                  DT::datatable(d), \n                  widths = 5)        \n\nSetting the `off` event (i.e., 'plotly_deselect') to match the `on` event (i.e., 'plotly_selected'). You can change this default via the `highlight()` function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight() is a function of plotly package. It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side.

It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document. Warning: This will bring in all of Bootstrap!."

    "text": "Overview\nWhen telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly rpackages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyrpackage, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\nBasic concepts of animation\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\nTerminology\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning."

Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = after_stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()\n\nWarning: The provided binwidth will cause dots to overflow the boundaries of the\ngeometry.\n→ Set `binwidth = NA` to automatically determine a binwidth that ensures dots\n  fit within the bounds,\n→ OR set `overflow = \"compress\"` to automatically reduce the spacing between\n  dots to ensure the dots fit within the bounds,\n→ OR set `overflow = \"keep\"` to allow dots to overflow the bounds of the\n  geometry without producing a warning.\nℹ For more information, see the documentation of the `binwidth` and `overflow`\n  arguments of `?ggdist::geom_dots()` or the section on constraining dot sizes\n  in vignette(\"dotsinterval\") (`vignette(ggdist::dotsinterval)`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\nIntroducing Ridgeline Plots (formerly Joyplots)\nClaus O.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10.

    "text": "ggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\n\n\n\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css &lt;- \"background-color:white; #&lt;&lt;\nfont-style:bold; color:black;\" #&lt;&lt;\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(    #&lt;&lt;\n    opts_tooltip(    #&lt;&lt;\n      css = tooltip_css)) #&lt;&lt;\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the background colour of the tooltip is black and the font colour is white and bold.\n\nRefer to Customizing girafe objects to learn more about how to customise ggiraph objects.\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.\n\ntooltip &lt;- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {\n  mean &lt;- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  sem &lt;- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  paste(\"Mean maths scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem)\n}\n\ngg_point &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n                   aes(x = RACE),\n) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS, \n                   tooltip = after_stat(  \n                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  \n    fun.data = \"mean_se\", \n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,  \n    fill = \"light blue\"\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS),\n    fun.data = mean_se,\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, size = 0.2\n  )\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\ngirafe(ggobj = gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below shows the second interactive feature of ggiraph, namely data_id.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(           \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),             \n    stackgroups = TRUE,               \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618                      \n)\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\nNote that the default value of the hover css is hover_css = “fill:orange;”.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, css codes are used to change the highlighting effect.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\nNote: Different from previous example, in this example the ccs customisation request are encoded directly.\n\n\n\nThere are time that we want to combine tooltip and hover effect on the interactive statistical graph as shown in the code chunk below.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = CLASS, \n        data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.

In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about, refer to Plot Assembly.\n\n\n\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'"

It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background."

Most individuals are concentrated in the lower income range, indicating that the majority of people in the five provinces of Vietnam have relatively low income, while only a small proportion earn high income.\n\n\nTotal Income by Gender\nData Preparation\nIn this step, numeric gender codes are transformed into categorical (character) variables to improve interpretability.

This transformation facilitates clearer presentation and interpretation in subsequent graphical and statistical analyses.\n\ndata_cgen &lt;- data %&gt;% mutate(Gender = case_when(CGEN == 1 ~ 'Male',\n                                            CGEN == 2 ~ 'Female'))\n\nGeom_Boxplot and Mean Comparison\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list.

Total income does not show an increasing trend as the number of working days increases, suggesting that longer working periods do not necessarily lead to higher income.\n\n\nTotal Income by Education Level\nData Preparation\nIn this section, the numeric codes representing education level are converted into categorical (character) variables to enhance clarity and interpretability. Specifically, the variable FEDU is recoded as “Primary”, “Lower secondary”, “Upper secondary”, and “Others”, allowing for meaningful comparison of total income across education levels.\n\ndata_fedu &lt;- data %&gt;% mutate(Education = case_when(FEDU == 0 ~ 'Primary',\n                                              FEDU == 1 ~ 'Lower secondary',\n                                              FEDU == 2 ~ 'Upper secondary',\n                                              FEDU == 3 ~ 'Others'))\ndata_fedu &lt;- data_fedu %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Education))\ndata_fedu$Education &lt;- factor(data_fedu$Education, levels = c('Primary', 'Lower secondary', 'Upper secondary', 'Others'))\n\nBoxplot and Statistical Comparison\nThe code chunk below plots boxplots by using geom_boxplot().\n\nggplot(data=data_fedu, \n       aes(y = TEIN, \n           x = Education)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun = \"mean\",         \n               colour =\"red\",        \n               size=4) +\n  ylim(0,175) +\n  labs(y = \"Total Income\")\n\nWarning: Removed 5 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 5 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_summary()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the box plot, we can observe that as the education level increases, total income tends to increase. The mean and median of total income is noticeably higher at higher education levels, suggesting that education is positively associated with total income.\nOne-way ANOVA Test: ggbetweenstats() method\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to generate a visualization for a one-way ANOVA test on total income by education level, in order to examine whether there are statistically significant differences in total income across education groups.\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = data_fedu,\n  x = Education, \n  y = TEIN,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE\n) + \n  labs(y = \"Total Income\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the results from the one-way ANOVA using ggbetweenstats, there are statistically significant differences in total income across different levels of education. Pairwise comparisons indicate that education groups differ significantly from each other, with higher education levels associated with higher total income. Overall, the four education categories show significant differences in total income, and total income increases as the level of education increases.\n\n\nTotal Income by Career Sector\nData Preparation\nIn this step, the numeric career codes are recoded into categorical (character) variables to improve interpretability. Specifically, the variable CJOB is recoded as “Agricultural sector”, “Service and industrial sector”, and “Others”. Observations with missing career information are removed, and the resulting variable is converted into a factor with an ordered level structure to facilitate clear visualization and statistical comparison of total income across career sectors.\n\ndata_cjob &lt;- data %&gt;% mutate(Careers = case_when(CJOB == 1 ~ 'Agricultural sector',\n                                              CJOB == 2 ~ 'Service and industrial sector',\n                                              CJOB == 3 ~ 'Others'))\ndata_cjob &lt;- data_cjob %&gt;% filter(!is.na(CJOB))\ndata_cjob$Careers &lt;- factor(data_cjob$Careers, levels = c('Agricultural sector',  'Service and industrial sector', 'Others'))\n\nBoxplot and Statistical Comparison\nThe code chunk below plots boxplots by using geom_boxplot().\n\nggplot(data=data_cjob, \n       aes(y = TEIN, \n           x = Careers)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun = \"mean\",         \n               colour =\"red\",        \n               size=4) +\n  ylim(0,175) +\n  labs(y = \"Total Income\")\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 4 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_summary()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot shows that total income differs across career sectors. Individuals in the agricultural sector have the lowest total income, and those in the service and industrial sector have moderately higher income. The “Others” category has slightly higher median (but lower mean) income than the service and industrial sector.\nOneway ANOVA Test: ggbetweenstats() method\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to generate a visualization for a one-way ANOVA test on total income by career sector, in order to examine whether there are statistically significant differences in total income across career sectors.\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = data_cjob,\n  x = Careers, \n  y = TEIN,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one-way ANOVA indicates that total income differs significantly across career sectors. Pairwise comparisons show that the difference in mean income between agricultural sector and service and industrial sector, as well as between agricultural sector and others are statistically significant, confirming that career sector has a measurable impact on total income.\n\n\nTotal Income by Technique\nData Preparation\nThe numeric variable FTAP is recoded into the categorical variable “Technique” with two levels (“Low” and “Adequate”), and missing values are removed to facilitate income comparison across farming techniques.\n\ndata_ftap &lt;- data %&gt;% mutate(Technique = case_when(FTAP == 1 ~ 'Low',\n                                              FTAP == 2 ~ 'Adequated'))\ndata_ftap &lt;- data_ftap %&gt;% filter(!is.na(FTAP))\ndata_ftap$Technique &lt;- factor(data_ftap$Technique, levels = c('Low',  'Adequated'))\n\nUsing geom_boxplot and ggbetweenstatsto compare total income by technique.\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=data_ftap, \n       aes(y = TEIN, \n           x = Technique)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun = \"mean\",         \n               colour =\"red\",        \n               size=4) +\n  ylim(0,175) +\n  labs(y = \"Total Income\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggbetweenstats(\n  data = data_ftap,\n  x = Technique, \n  y = TEIN,\n  type = \"np\",\n  messages = FALSE\n) + \n  labs(y = \"Total Income\")\n\np1 + p2\n\nWarning: Removed 3 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_boxplot()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 3 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_summary()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot shows that individuals using adequate techniques have slightly higher total income compared to those using low-level techniques. Both the median and mean total income are higher for the adequate technique group. However, the results from ggbetweenstats (nonparametric test) indicate that the difference in total income between the two technique groups is not statistically significant."

    "text": "Overview\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coefficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coefficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\n\nTo reveal the relationship between high-dimensional variables pair-wisely.\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrices as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\n\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\n\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R.

In this section, you will learn how to create a scatterplot matrix by using the pairs function of R Graphics.\nBefore you continue to the next step, you should read the syntax description of pairsfunction.\n\nBuilding a basic correlation matrix\nFigure below shows the scatter plot matrix of Wine Quality Data. It is a 11 by 11 matrix.\n\npairs(wine[,1:11])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe required input of pairs() can be a matrix or data frame. The code chunk used to create the scatterplot matrix is relatively simple. It uses the default pairs function. Columns 2 to 12 of wine dataframe is used to build the scatterplot matrix. The variables are: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing the lower corner\npairs function of R Graphics provided many customisation arguments. For example, it is a common practice to show either the upper half or lower half of the correlation matrix instead of both.

    "text": "Visualising Correlation Matrix using corrplotPackage\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will focus on corrplot. However, you are encouraged to explore the other two packages too.\nBefore getting started, you are required to read An Introduction to corrplot Package in order to gain basic understanding of corrplot package.\n\nGetting started with corrplot\nBefore we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\nIn the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\nwine.cor &lt;- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the default visual object used to plot the corrgram is circle. The default layout of the corrgram is a symmetric matrix. The default colour scheme is diverging blue-red. Blue colours are used to represent pair variables with positive correlation coefficients and red colours are used to represent pair variables with negative correlation coefficients. The intensity of the colour or also know as saturation is used to represent the strength of the correlation coefficient. Darker colours indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\nWorking with visual geometrics\nIn corrplot package, there are seven visual geometrics (parameter method) can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. The default is circle. As shown in the previous section, the default visual geometric of corrplot matrix is circle. However, this default setting can be changed by using the methodargument as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with layout\ncorrplor() supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”. The default is “full” which display full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the type argument of corrplot().\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default layout of the corrgram can be further customised. For example, arguments diagand tl.col are used to turn off the diagonal cells and to change the axis text label colour to black colour respectively as shown in the code chunk and figure below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with mixed layout\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\nFigure below shows a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk used to plot the corrgram are shown below.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that argument lower and upper are used to define the visualisation method used. In this case ellipse is used to map the lower half of the corrgram and numerical matrix (i.e. number) is used to map the upper half of the corrgram. The argument tl.pos, on the other, is used to specify the placement of the axis label. Lastly, the diag argument is used to specify the glyph on the principal diagonal of the corrgram.\n\n\nCombining corrgram with the significant test\nIn statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables their correlation coefficients are statistically significant.\nFigure below shows a corrgram combined with the significant test. The corrgram reveals that not all correlation pairs are statistically significant. For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at significant level of 0.1 but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid.\nWith corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReorder a corrgram\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n“AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in seriation package.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReordering a correlation matrix using hclust\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

We will still use the wh_matrix as the input data.\n\nWorking with heatmaply\n\nheatmaply(mtcars)\n\nWarning in doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler): unable to load shared object '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/modules//R_X11.so':\n  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/modules//R_X11.so, 0x0006): Library not loaded: /opt/X11/lib/libSM.6.dylib\n  Referenced from: &lt;7ECC4104-EC6A-38FD-9BEA-BFE0B870925C&gt; /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.5-arm64/Resources/modules/R_X11.so\n  Reason: tried: '/opt/X11/lib/libSM.6.dylib' (no such file), '/System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes/OS/opt/X11/lib/libSM.6.dylib' (no such file), '/opt/X11/lib/libSM.6.dylib' (no such file), '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib/libSM.6.dylib' (no such file), '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.18+10/Contents/Home/lib/server/libSM.6.dylib' (no such file)\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\nℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the dendextend package.\n  Please report the issue at &lt;https://github.com/talgalili/dendextend/issues&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows the basic syntax needed to create n interactive heatmap by using heatmaply package.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\nDifferent from heatmap(), for heatmaply() the default horizontal dendrogram is placed on the left hand side of the heatmap.\nThe text label of each raw, on the other hand, is placed on the right hand side of the heat map.\nWhen the x-axis marker labels are too long, they will be rotated by 135 degree from the north.\n\n\n\nData trasformation\nWhen analysing multivariate data set, it is very common that the variables in the data sets includes values that reflect different types of measurement. In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.\nThree main data transformation methods are supported by heatmaply(), namely: scale, normalise and percentilse.\n\nScaling method\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to scale variable values columewise.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalising method\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\nDifferent from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentising method\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\nSimilar to Normalize method, the Percentize method is also performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClustering algorithm\nheatmaply supports a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithm. The main arguments provided are:\n\ndistfun: function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist. The options “pearson”, “spearman” and “kendall” can be used to use correlation-based clustering, which uses as.dist(1 - cor(t(x))) as the distance metric (using the specified correlation method).\nhclustfun: function used to compute the hierarchical clustering when Rowv or Colv are not dendrograms. Defaults to hclust.\ndist_method default is NULL, which results in “euclidean” to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to distfun. By default distfun is “dist”” hence this can be one of “euclidean”, “maximum”, “manhattan”, “canberra”, “binary” or “minkowski”.\nhclust_method default is NULL, which results in “complete” method to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun. By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n\nManual approach\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmap is plotted by using hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical approach\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend()and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\nwh_d &lt;- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\nwh_clust &lt;- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k &lt;- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nWith reference to the statistical analysis results, we can prepare the code chunk as shown below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeriation\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'gclus':\n  method         from     \n  reorder.hclust seriation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with colour palettes\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe finishing touch\nBeside providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

It is ideal for comparing multiple variables together and seeing the relationships between them. For example, the variables contribute to Happiness Index. Parallel coordinates was invented by Alfred Inselberg in the 1970s as a way to visualize high-dimensional data. This data visualisation technique is more often found in academic and scientific communities than in business and consumer data visualizations. As pointed out by Stephen Few(2006), “This certainly isn’t a chart that you would present to the board of directors or place on your Web site for the general public. In fact, the strength of parallel coordinates isn’t in their ability to communicate some truth in the data to others, but rather in their ability to bring meaningful multivariate patterns and comparisons to light when used interactively for analysis.” For example, parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterise clusters detected during customer segmentation.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:\n\nplotting statistic parallel coordinates plots by using ggparcoord() of GGally package, and\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parallelPlot package."

    "text": "Plotting Static Parallel Coordinates Plot\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord() of GGally package. Before getting started, it is a good practice to read the function description in detail.\n\nPlotting a simple parallel coordinates\nCode chunk below shows a typical syntax used to plot a basic static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that only two argument namely data and columns is used. Data argument is used to map the data object (i.e. wh) and columns is used to select the columns for preparing the parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\nPlotting a parallel coordinates with boxplot\nThe basic parallel coordinates failed to reveal any meaning understanding of the World Happiness measures. In this section, you will learn how to makeover the plot by using a collection of arguments provided by ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Parallel Coordinates Plot of World Happines Variables\")\n\nWarning: The following aesthetics were dropped during statistical transformation:\ncolour.\nℹ This can happen when ggplot fails to infer the correct grouping structure in\n  the data.\nℹ Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical\n  variable into a factor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\ngroupColumn argument is used to group the observations (i.e. parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e. Region) and colour the parallel coordinates lines by region name.\nscale argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using uniminmax method. The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.\nalphaLines argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.\nboxplot argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical TRUE. The default is FALSE.\ntitle argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.\n\n\n\nParallel coordinates with facet\nSince ggparcoord() is developed by extending ggplot2 package, we can combination use some of the ggplot2 function when plotting a parallel coordinates plot.\nIn the code chunk below, facet_wrap() of ggplot2 is used to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates plots. Each plot represent one geographical region such as East Asia.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the aesthetic defect of the current design is that some of the variable names overlap on x-axis.\n\n\nRotating x-axis text label\nTo make the x-axis text label easy to read, let us rotate the labels by 30 degrees. We can rotate axis text labels using theme() function in ggplot2 as shown in the code chunk below\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nTo rotate x-axis text labels, we use axis.text.x as argument to theme() function. And we specify element_text(angle = 30) to rotate the x-axis text by an angle 30 degree.\n\n\n\nAdjusting the rotated x-axis text label\nRotating x-axis text labels to 30 degrees makes the label overlap with the plot and we can avoid this by adjusting the text location using hjust argument to theme’s text element with element_text(). We use axis.text.x as we want to change the look of x-axis text.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust=1))"

They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).\nsample_n() and sample_frac() sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.\nsummarise() computes the summary for each group.\n\nIn our case, group_by() will used together with summarise() to derive the summarised data.frame.\n\n\nGrouped summaries without the Pipe\nThe code chank below shows a typical two lines code approach to perform the steps.\n\nrealis2018_grouped &lt;- group_by(realis2018, `Project Name`,\n                               `Planning Region`, `Planning Area`, \n                               `Property Type`, `Type of Sale`)\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- summarise(realis2018_grouped, \n                          `Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE), \n                          `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Project Name', 'Planning Region',\n'Planning Area', 'Property Type'. You can override using the `.groups`\nargument.\n\n\nNote\n\nAggregation functions such as sum() and meadian() obey the usual rule of missing values: if there’s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value. The argument na.rm = TRUE removes the missing values prior to computation.\n\nThe code chunk above is not very efficient because we have to give each intermediate data.frame a name, even though we don’t have to care about it.\n\n\nGrouped summaries with the pipe\nThe code chunk below shows a more efficient way to tackle the same processes by using the pipe, %&gt;%:\nRecommendation\nTo learn more about pipe, visit this excellent article: Pipes in R Tutorial For Beginners.\n\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- realis2018 %&gt;% \n  group_by(`Project Name`,`Planning Region`, \n           `Planning Area`, `Property Type`, \n           `Type of Sale`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE), \n            `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Project Name', 'Planning Region',\n'Planning Area', 'Property Type'.

    "section": "Designing Treemap with treemap Package",
    "text": "Designing Treemap with treemap Package\ntreemap package is a R package specially designed to offer great flexibility in drawing treemaps. The core function, namely: treemap() offers at least 43 arguments. In this section, we will only explore the major arguments for designing elegent and yet truthful treemaps.\n\nDesigning a static treemap\nIn this section, treemap() of Treemap package is used to plot a treemap showing the distribution of median unit prices and total unit sold of resale condominium by geographic hierarchy in 2017.\nFirst, we will select records belongs to resale condominium property type from realis2018_selected data frame.\n\nrealis2018_selected &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\", `Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\n\n\nUsing the basic arguments\nThe code chunk below designed a treemap by using three core arguments of treemap(), namely: index, vSize and vColor.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the three arguments used:\n\nindex\n\nThe index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.\nIf multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.\n\nvSize\n\nThe column must not contain negative values. This is because it’s vaues will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.\n\n\nWarning:\nThe treemap above was wrongly coloured. For a correctly designed treemap, the colours of the rectagles should be in different intensity showing, in our case, median unit prices.\nFor treemap(), vColor is used in combination with the argument type to determines the colours of the rectangles. Without defining type, like the code chunk above, treemap()assumes type = index, in our case, the hierarchy of planning areas.\n\n\nWorking with vColor and type arguments\nIn the code chunk below, type argument is define as value.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type = \"value\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking to learn from the conde chunk above.\n\nThe rectangles are coloured with different intensity of green, reflecting their respective median unit prices.\nThe legend reveals that the values are binned into ten bins, i.e. 0-5000, 5000-10000, etc. with an equal interval of 5000.\n\n\n\nColours in treemap package\nThere are two arguments that determine the mapping to color palettes: mapping and palette. The only difference between “value” and “manual” is the default value for mapping. The “value” treemap considers palette to be a diverging color palette (say ColorBrewer’s “RdYlBu”), and maps it in such a way that 0 corresponds to the middle color (typically white or yellow), -max(abs(values)) to the left-end color, and max(abs(values)), to the right-end color. The “manual” treemap simply maps min(values) to the left-end color, max(values) to the right-end color, and mean(range(values)) to the middle color.\n\n\nThe “value” type treemap\nThe code chunk below shows a value type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nalthough the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\nThe “manual” type treemap\nThe “manual” type does not interpret the values as the “value” type does. Instead, the value range is mapped linearly to the colour palette.\nThe code chunk below shows a manual type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nThe colour scheme used is very copnfusing. This is because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)). It is not wise to use diverging colour palette such as RdYlBu if the values are all positive or negative\n\nTo overcome this problem, a single colour palette such as Blues should be used.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreemap Layout\ntreemap() supports two popular treemap layouts, namely: “squarified” and “pivotSize”. The default is “pivotSize”.\nThe squarified treemap algorithm (Bruls et al., 2000) produces good aspect ratios, but ignores the sorting order of the rectangles (sortID). The ordered treemap, pivot-by-size, algorithm (Bederson et al., 2002) takes the sorting order (sortID) into account while aspect ratios are still acceptable.\n\n\nWorking with algorithm argument\nThe code chunk below plots a squarified treemap by changing the algorithm argument.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing sortID\nWhen “pivotSize” algorithm is used, sortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )"
